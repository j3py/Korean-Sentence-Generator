# Korean Sentence Generator

### This is a simple script for generating random sentences in Korean
### What?

* I randomly take one or two Hangul syllables strings
* Concatenate that to a subject particle, '는' or '은' for now
* Concatenate that to another one or two random Hangul syllables
* Concatenate that to an object particle, '를' or '을' for now
* Concatenate that to another one or two random Hangul syllables
* And finally add a generic verb ending, '습니다' for now
* Ta-da! A half-assed, random Korean sentence that almost certainly does not make sense

### Why?

* I want to eventually make a Korean chat bot so I can learn Korean.
* Duolingo doesn't offer Korean yet and their English course for Koreans can only get me so far.
* I love Duolingo's chat bots though so maybe I can replicate that myself.

### Where?

* [Here's a JSFiddle of it running][1].  You have to press their "Run" button in the upper left-hand corner.
